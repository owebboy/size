# size
size is a basic framework for defining dimensions through CSS classes based on preset sizing options that can be changed through the stylus stylesheetâ€™s variables. Size is super fast and incredibly simple to use. It identifies the four major CSS sizing options: margin, padding, width, and height. For the classes to work, the different sizes are as follows:

- n = 0
- xs = .1em
- s = .25em
- m = .5em
- l = 1em
- x = 2em
- xl = 3em
- xxl = 4em
- max = 100%
